# Product Landing Page Template

This gorgeous responsive website is a static landing page built with React, styled-components, react-router, and react hooks. All the components are reusable and can be used for any dynamic content. It's fully responsive for all the platforms and hosted using Netlify

# Description 

This is a static landing page ususally used for marketting of products. You can navigate to different pages possible due to react-router. I always wanted to learn styled-components and building a project is a practical way to learn it.
The only challenge I faced is using styled-components, it was intimidating at first and since I used regular CSS and SASS it was weird without any classnames. Atleast styled-components are similar to SASS in terms of nesting. I also need to get used to the different folder structure you make while using styled-components. Anyways I refered to this doc - [styled component doc](https://styled-components.com/).
